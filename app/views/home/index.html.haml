              %p
                Accountability and reliability is critical when hiring contractors. On Staffwisely, you're dealing with companies, not individuals. 
                So you know exactly who you're working with.

              %h3 Scale on-demand
              %p
                Hiring full-time employees to support a project is expensive and it takes a lot of time. Reinforce your core team by hiring contractors on-demand
                at a fraction of the cost.
